Refer to the pandas documentation (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html) 
to find a method which allows you to create a pandas dataframe from a dictionary.

Import the dictionary thermo from thermo.py and convert it to a pandas dataframe.
Your resulting dataframe should have substances as rows with deltaH and deltaG as columns.
The conversion should be done in a single command without restructuring the data.
